   <div class="text">"Memory is a tough place. you were there. If this is not the truth, 
   it is not a lie. There are benefirs to being with nostalgia. 
   Certaintly nostalgia and being without nostalgia relieve the past. 
   Sitting here, there are no memories to remember, just the ball going back 
   and forth. Shored up by this external net, the problem is not one of a 
   lack of memories; the problem is simply a lack, a lack before, during, and
    after. The chin anf vheek fit into the palm of your hand. 
    Feeling better? The ball isn't being returned. 
    Someone is approching the umpire. Someone is upset now"
